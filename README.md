## üöÄ Project Overview

This enterprise-grade dashboard simulates **trade Profit & Loss (PnL) attribution** workflows used by hedge funds and banks. It breaks down trade performance by **instrument, trader, and strategy**, providing detailed insights into key drivers such as market movement, FX impacts, execution slippage, and strategy logic.  

The dashboard integrates **anomaly detection** to flag unusual trade patterns, enabling risk and compliance teams to proactively monitor portfolio health and potential risks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) for data processing & modeling  
- **SQL** for data querying and transformation  
- **Power BI** for interactive, dynamic visualizations  
- **Apache Airflow** for orchestration and pipeline automation  
- **AWS Redshift & S3** for scalable cloud data storage and querying  
- **dbt** for modular, version-controlled data transformations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Comprehensive PnL Attribution:** Break down trade PnL into Market Movement, FX, Execution Slippage, and Strategy Logic components  
- **Dynamic Drill-Down Dashboards:** Filter views by asset class, desk, trader, and timeframe for granular analysis  
- **Automated ETL Pipelines:** Data ingestion, transformation, and loading orchestrated via Airflow and dbt  
- **Anomaly Detection Module:** Identify and flag suspicious trade patterns and performance outliers leveraging statistical methods  
- **Scalable Cloud Architecture:** Utilizes AWS Redshift and S3 for handling multi-asset, large-scale datasets
