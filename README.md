Project Title: Enterprise DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD

Overview

This project demonstrates a robust, enterprise-level DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and GitOps with ArgoCD. The project integrates advanced security practices with fully automated build, test, and deployment workflows, leveraging industry-standard tools and techniques to ensure a secure and resilient software delivery lifecycle.

Key Features

CI/CD Pipeline: Using GitHub Actions to automate code build, test, and deployment.

GitOps: Leveraging ArgoCD for deployment to Kubernetes clusters.

Security Integration: SAST, DAST, SCA, and IaC security testing.

Tooling: Jenkins, SonarQube, JFrog Artifactory, Trivy, Aqua Security, OWASP ZAP.

Deployment: Automating to Kubernetes with Helm and ArgoCD.

Monitoring & Alerting: Prometheus, Grafana, and security incident alerts.

Tools & Technologies

CI/CD: GitHub Actions

GitOps: ArgoCD

Build Automation: Jenkins, Gradle, Maven

Security Tools: SonarQube (SAST), OWASP ZAP (DAST), Trivy (Container Scanning), Checkov (IaC Security)

Artifact Management: JFrog Artifactory

Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes

Deployment Management: Helm, ArgoCD

Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

Prerequisites

GitHub account and repository access

Kubernetes cluster with kubectl configured

ArgoCD installed and configured

Docker installed locally

Jenkins server (optional for extended integration)

Step-by-Step Implementation

Project Setup

Create a GitHub repository

Set up branch protection rules

CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

Create GitHub Actions workflows for:

Code build and test

Security scans (SAST, DAST, SCA)

Artifact storage in JFrog Artifactory

Security Integration

Add SonarQube for static code analysis

Configure OWASP ZAP for dynamic application testing

Use Trivy for container scanning

Implement Checkov for IaC scanning

GitOps with ArgoCD

Configure ArgoCD to sync with the GitHub repository

Use Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment

Automate deployment triggers through GitHub Actions

Monitoring and Alerting

Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection

Use Grafana for visualizing CI/CD health and security metrics

Set up alerts for failed builds and security issues

Demonstration

Provide screenshots or videos of pipeline runs

Include logs showing successful security scans and deployments

Showcase dashboards from Prometheus and Grafana

Additional Tips

Highlight reusability of workflows

Emphasize security and compliance aspects

Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern DevSecOps practices using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD, showcasing skills in CI/CD automation, security integration, and infrastructure management.
